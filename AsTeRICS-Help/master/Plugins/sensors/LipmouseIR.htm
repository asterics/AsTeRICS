<H1>LipmouseIR</H1> 
<H3>Component Type: Sensor (Subcategory:Sensor Modules)</H3>
<p>
This component provides signals from the Lipmouse module, which allows computer control via a mouthpiece. 
The user can create input signals with 3 degrees of freedom by interacting with the mouthpiece: left/right, up/down and sip/puff.
The horizontal and vertical movements are measured via force sensors inside the lipmouse module. The sip/puff actions are measured via a pressure sensor.
The lipmouse can be adjusted to very low force that it can be used by persons with severly reduced motor capabilites (e.g. late stage musculuar dystrophy or quadraplegia up to C1/C2 lesions).
Additionally the Lipmouse has an infrared interface which enables it to control electronic devices.
Through a receiver it is possible to record commands from existing remote controls and store the codes to a database.
When needed, the IR signal is reconstructed and transmitted to the device to be controlled.

<H2>Requirements</H2>
The LipmouseIR module must be connected to a USB port. Firmware for the lipmouseIR sensor can be found in the folder CIMs/Lipmouse_CIM.
The free "teensy loader" tool can be used to update the firmware of the lipmouseIR module.
Detailed design documentation will be provided in the future.

<H2>IR Code Database</H2>
The database which contains the IR codes as well as the information about the type and name of the device and the specific function is a comma separated value file.
The first value is the type, the second one is the name and the third one is the function. The following 512 values are the IR code. 
This database is automatically generated and maintained if new IR codes are recorded with the Lipmouse with IR functions.
