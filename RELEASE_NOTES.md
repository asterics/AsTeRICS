### v2.8 (2016-07-07)
Release with major changes under the hood regarding ARE licensing and customized packaging with APE:
	Licensing: Changed licenses of ARE, services and plugins to a dual license MIT or GPLv3 witch CLASSPATH exception. The individual licenses can be found in the bin/ARE/LICENSE folder
	
* Plugin development made easier: 
  * No no need for files bin/ARE/profile/loader.ini, bin/ARE/profile/loader_mini.ini and bin/ARE/profile/loader_componentlist.ini
  * Improved loading of plugin osgi bundles and fixed exception handling
  * Simplified fetching resources like data files utilizing newly introduced class ResourceRegistry: https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS/blob/master/ARE/middleware/src/main/java/eu/asterics/mw/services/ResourceRegistry.java
	
  * moved log files to tmp subfolder
  * Added webservice homepage to document root of ARE: data/webservice: including improved websocket demo and javascript REST API demo. Start ARE --webservice and open http://localhost:8081/
  * Added Asterics Packaging Environment (APE) which let's you create customized and downstripped standalone packages (including native installer and launcher) for a given model file: https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS/tree/master/bin/APE
  * Simplified Java Dependencies: 
    Mixed installations of JREs, JDKs (32bit, 64bit, Java 7 or 8) are supported now. bin/ARE/findjava.bat searches for the best 32bit JRE found on the system. Execution with 64bit is allowed now, only warning is given
  * Iprovement for development: All code is compiled for target level java 7, several JDKs can coexist.
	
  * Improved build system: Added build file to AsTeRICS root directory.
  * Added ARE REST API libraries for Java and javascript including example implementation: https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS/tree/master/ARE_RestAPIlibraries
  * Removed dependency for external Visual Studio 2010 Redistributable installation: They .dlls are included in the bin/ARE folder
  * Added official support for Mac OS X
  * Added ARE installer for Linux and Mac OS X
  * Models can send ARE to system tray including startup models --> Invisible for user
  * ACS to ARE connectivity can be disabled, registering of UDP port is skipped in such a case --> no popup of firewall: see bin/ARE/areProperties
  * ACS to ARE connection port can be configured, see bin/ARE/areProperties
  * Improved ARE error messages at startup and improved exception handling for deploying and starting models.
  * In case of just one model file, there is no need for autostart.acs model.

  * Many, many bug fixes including Java8/Windows 10 support: https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS/milestone/4?closed=1 
	
  * New Plugins:
    * RandomNumber
    * GMailShortcuts: Emulate shortcuts to operate GMail Web client
    * IntelRealSense: Intel Real Sense 3D camera support on Windows 8.1 64 bit machines.
    * ComPort, SeriaPort: Generic serial port interfacing with support for binary and string data.
    * OpenHAB: Interfacing a OpenHAB server: Controlling SmartHome attached to an OpenHAB server and reading sensor values from there
    * StringFilter: Filter incoming string and decide and extract parts. Forward residual string to output port or trigger events: --> very useful in conjunction with CellBoard.
    * HoverPanel: Single button that can be positioned anywhere on the screen, can be triggered by hovering (staying still on button, no mouse click): very useful for eye tracking.
    * OpenBCI: Plugin for interfacing EEG devices which are compatible to the openBCI packet fromat
	
  * Major Changes/Improvements in Plugins
    * FS20Sender, FS20Receiver, EasyHomeControl: ported to all platforms (Win, Linux incl. Raspi, Mac OSX) using javahidapi
    * KNX: Supported dynamic data points and provide compobox selection for datatypes. Also read values from datapoints
    * enOcean: Improved, bug fixed lib
    * WebSocket: Added Output Port: The plugin can now receive data through the websocket.
    * CellBoard: Many improvements in CellBoard editor: Support for several levels for keyboard files and 'Back' action --> Only one model for AAC with submenus necessary.
    * Timer: Bug fixes when starting/restarting

    * javacv: Reorganized into platform specific bundles to get smaller packages; Removed ffmpeg lib in javacv-*-basic-*.jar. Optionally a bigger javacv-*-full-*.jar including ffmpeg can be created.
    * JNativeHook service: Upgraded to version 2.0.3
    * grizzly-http-service: upgraded to version 2.3.23
    
### Version 3.0
* Activation of embedded webserver (including websocket and REST API) by default. No flag --webservice needed any more.

  * Implementation of the new webserver document root specification: https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS/wiki/AsTeRICS-webserver-document-root-specification
  * Integration of [WebACS](https://github.com/asterics/WebACS) as webapp
  * Integration of the new [webbased help system](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-help) for ARE and for WebACS
* The C# ACS now also uses the new help system instead of the windows only version.
* ARE startup automatically detectes plugin jar changes through MD5 hashes. If changes are detected new cache files and a new component collection is generated.
* XFacetrackerLK upgraded to [JavaCV 1.3](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv/tree/1.3) and now works on all platforms (Linux, RPi, Mac, Windows) x86 and x64
* Improved x64 support for many plugins
* Improved AppplicationLauncher plugin to support crossplatform invocation of applications and URLs.
* Added shortcut and gui buttons to control panel of ARE to open webserver hp and currently deployed model in WebACS.
* Reworked ARE webpage.
