<FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><h1>BNCI Evaluation Suite</h1></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the following
Documentation pages we report on the different modules implemented
for the BNCI Evaluation Suite. This toolbox aims at the
implementation of several functionalities around the Enobio sensor
for the realization of BCI functionalities. The idea if the toolkit
is to provide some functionalities in Matlab that can be combined for
prototyping and evaluating BCI solutions. These can be implemented
within the toolkit or together with further BCI prototyping MATLAB
toolkits like <A HREF="http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/BCILAB">BCILAB</A>.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BCI systems attain to
translate brain signals, which can include several physiological
modalities, into control commands of a particular device, e.g.
wheelchair, computer, mobile phone, robot arm. A generic block
diagram of such systems can be observed in Figure 1. Taking such a
structure as a reference, if a system makes use of a classification
procedure as feature translator, the resulting system can be analysed
from a pattern recognition perspective. This is the approach we
follow in the BNCI Evaluation Suite. Therefore you can find
functionalities for feature extraction and for classification in
multi-class problems.</P>

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Different paradigms for
the realization of BCI exist. Among them the more common used ones
are so-called motor imagery, P300, and SSEVP. The implementation
works described herein are focused on the motor imagery, where
control commands are generated upon the classification of the
corresponding EEG signal streams into diverse classes, and p300
paradigms, where control signals are generated after a particular
Event Related Potential (ERP) placed at 300 ms after setting of
stimuli. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the here described
works we have decided to use two different frameworks respectively
for motor imagery and P300 data classification. The work by Gao
Xiaorong and colleagues presented at the BCI Competition III and
described <A HREF="http://www.bbci.de/competition/iii/results/graz_IIIa/GaoXiaorong_desc.pdf">here</A>,
has been implemented for the motor imagery paradigm. Some variations
of the original work as described in <A HREF="http://www.asterics.eu/index.php?id=37">[Cester
and Soria, 2011]</A> have been implemented.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the P300 code we
provide the code presented in <A HREF="http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/~arakotom/publi/rakoto_bci.pdf">[Rakotomamonjy
and Guige, 2008]</A>. We offer the code as <A HREF="http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/~arakotom/code/bciindex.html">provided</A>
by the authors, together with a refinement we have undertaken in
order to refine the function interfaces. Our version of the code is
the current version of a work in progress.</P>
