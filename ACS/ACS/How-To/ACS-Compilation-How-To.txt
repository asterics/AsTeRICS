Hot-To to compile the AsTeRICS ACS Sourcecode with Visual Studio (2010)
Date: 2012-02-23

1. Install Visual Studio
The ACS buildflow is testet with VS 2010, the usage of VS 2010 is recommended. Using the free VS2010 express version may be is possible 
but has not been tested by now(with some restriction – for example no editor for GUI creation).

2. Install SVN plugin for Visual Studio 
If the subversion repository should be accessed within VisualStudio, please install a SVN-extension for VS. The plugin “AnkhSvn” is recommended, 
it can be found in the “HowTo” subfolder in the SVN repository, or be downloaded at:
http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/

3. Install Microsoft Ribbon Library
The Microsoft Ribbon Library has to be installed. 
The Ribbon Library used for the compilation of the ACS is version v4.0.0.11019.1 It can be downloaded at:
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=11877

4. Install the ResXFileCodeGenerator
For making the Resource file (for language support) also available in the .xaml format, a new code generator has to be installed. This is not required 
for the building process of the ACS, but it helps when developing/editing the XAML-Files. Downlaod the CodeGenerator for the Homepage 
(http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/ResXFileCodeGeneratorEx.aspx) and install it. 
If you are using VS2010, also add the “ResXFileCodeGeneratorEx.reg” to your Windows-registry by double clicking it. 
This file can be found in the “HowTo” subfolder of the ACS.
