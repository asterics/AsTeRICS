#Set the base URI of the ARE to use
#Default: Automatically checks several path locations (dependencies subfolder, ../AsTeRICS, ../../AsTeRICS and C:/Program Files (x86)/AsTeRICS/ARE/ 

#Either set to path of installed AsTeRICS
#ARE.baseURI=C:/Program Files (x86)/AsTeRICS/ARE/
#or to AsTeRICS snapshot 
#ARE.baseURI=dependencies/AsTeRICS/bin/ARE/

#Set the model src file(s) / src folder(s), either relative to APE.projectDir or as absolute directory or file URIs
#Seperate several URIs by semicolon (;)
#Default: bin/ARE/models (this value will always be appended to the property to include custom models in the custom/bin/ARE/models subfolder)
#APE.models=../../ARE/models/CameraMouse.acs;../../ARE/models/ImageDemo.acs

#The path to the build folder, can be relative or absolute
#Default: build
#APE.buildDir=build/

#Select copy mode for ARE/data folder.
#Possible values: all|single|none
#all: Copy all data files of the ARE installation folder
#single: Try to determine the referenced resources in a model and only copy that files (EXPERIMENTAL)
#none: Don't copy any data files (If data files are needed provide them through the custom/bin/ARE/data folder)  
#Default: all
#APE.dataCopyMode=all

#Select copy mode for files in the web server document root
#Possible values: all|none
#Default: all
#APE.webCopyMode=all

#Build Modes: 
#devel: Optimization of the workflow for development: no clean of build; only copies jars, if build/merged folder is empty; if copying jar, copy all jars instead of just referenced ones.
#release: clean, APE-copy with referenced jars only
#Default: devel
#APE.buildMode=devel
