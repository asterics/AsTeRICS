# Welcome to AsTeRICS
-------------------

AsTeRICS is a free and Open-Source graphical construction set for assistive technologies (AT).
It allows the creation of flexible solutions for people with disabilities using a large set of sensors and actuators.


Possible applications are  
* Computer input (mouse, keyboard, joystick)
* Environmental Control (KNX, FS20, IR, EnOcean, openHAB)
* Toys and Games (Playstation 3, computer games, RC-toys ...)
* Brain/Neural computer interfaces (Enobio, OpenVIBE, OpenEEG)
* Android Phone support (SMS, calls)
* and many more!

For more information see our website http://www.asterics.eu.

## Quick Build Instructions
To clone and compile the AsTeRICS framework, please execute the following steps:

1. Clone Repository (submodules will be cloned during build)
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS.git
  ```
2. Install the [**Java Development Kit (JDK, 32bit preferred) >= 8**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * Ensure to set ```JAVA_HOME``` to the folder where you installed the Java JDK and add the JDK bin path to the  Environment Variable ```Path```
3. [apache ant build framework (version >= 1.9.1)](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi)
  * Ensure to set ```ANT_HOME``` to the folder where you installed ant and add the ant bin path to the Environment Variable ```Path```
  * The ```git``` command line tool must be available from within ant, ensure to set the Environment Variable ```Path``` to the respective ```bin``` folder.
4. Open a terminal and start the AsTeRICS Runtime Environment (ARE) by calling:

  ```
  ant run
  ```
  
 If you don't need commandline support, you can use an IDE for Java Developers, e.g. [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/neon3), which already contains ant. There you can directly execute ant targets by selecting the build file ```build.xml``` and select the target of choice, e.g. ```run```.

##### How to apply the dual licensing

You may use these components under the terms of the MIT License, if no source code (plugins, services, libraries, ...) which is contained in your desired collection of ARE plugins and services is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
In order for that, you can remove unneeded plugins or services.

**Please note:** There are also some plugins (e.g. MathEvaluator, VLC) which are **GPL without CLASSPATH** exception, so in this case your license would have to be **GPL** as well.

Please have a look at the individual licenses of the AsTeRICS plugins and services. You find the license files in the subfolder LICENSE of every plugin.
