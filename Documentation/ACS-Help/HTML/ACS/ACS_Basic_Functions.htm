<h1>ACS Basic Functions</h1>
<p>The figure below shows the main panel of the AsTeRICS Configuration Suite after the application has started. The screen is divided in four main areas, the menu area (1), the <em>Deployment</em> area (2) (where the drawing will be done), the <em>GUI Designer</em> area (3), switchable with the <em>Deployment</em> area and the <em>Properties</em> area (4), where the settings of the components can be adapted.</p>

<p>Additionally, the main menu will open, if the AsTeRICS-Button is pressed in the menu bar - see figure below. All functions of the main menu are also reachable via buttons in the tabs, except the <em>About</em> and the <em>Print</em> dialog. This dialog shows general information about the ACS and the AsTeRICS project. </p>
