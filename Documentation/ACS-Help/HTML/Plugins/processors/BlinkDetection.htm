<H3>Component Type: Processor (Subcategory: DSP and Feature Detection)</H3>
<p>This component detects the shape that a blink produces in an electro-oculogram signal. The plugin analyses the input samples and recognises both a single blink and a double blink. Here a single blink is defined by an action whereby both eyes are simultaneously and voluntary closed and open. A double blink refers to the repletion of this action twice in an consecutive way. When one of these conditions is found the corresponding event is fired. In addition, a true Boolean will be output to the corresponding output port.</p>

<H2>Requirements</H2>
The input signal shall correspond to a 250-Hz sampled electro-oculogram signal, i.e., an output port of the <a href="../sensors/Enobio.htm">Enobio</a> component when the corresponding electrode is placed on the user's forehead.
<H2>Input Port Description</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>input [integer]:</STRONG> Input values that correspond to a 250-Hz sampled electro-oculogram signal.</li>
</ul>
<H2>Event Trigger Description</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>BlinkDetected:</STRONG> This event port fires an event if a blink is detected in the input sequence of integers.</li>
<li><STRONG>DoubleblinkDetected:</STRONG> This event port fires an event if a double blink is detected in the input sequence of integers.</li>
</ul>
