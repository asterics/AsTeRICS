		<H2>Supported OSes</H2>
		Windows (x86,x64), Linux (x86, x64, arm(Raspberry Pi)), Mac OSX(x86, x64)
		<H2>Troubleshooting problems under Win8/Win8.1</H2>
		Under Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, there can be problems concering the
		operation of the EasyHome device: If the red control led stays stays dark eaven if a command is send
		and the EasyHome sender cannot be used, the reason could be that the power management
		settings on Win8/8.1 switch the device off per default - this can be changed by applying the following steps:
		<ul>
			<li>Open the Device Manager (usually can be selected by right-clicking at the bottom left corner of your windows desktop)</li>
			<li>Open the device group "Human Interface Devices"</li>
			<li>Locate the device which pops up when you insert or remove the EasyHome module to/from an USB port
			   It should be a "HID compliant supplier defined device". You can distinguish different devices by right-clicking a device
			   and looking into rider "details" and "properites" - there you can find the VID and PID values, e.g. under property "last known parent"</li>
			<li> Note the VID and PID values. For example if you see a line like "USB\VID_1B1F&PID_C00F\EEE0000473" the values are VID:1B1F and PID:C00F</li>
			   
			<li>Press the Windows-Key and "R" to open the command window. Type "regedit" and press enter</li>
			<li>Select the entry "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" > "SYSTEM" > "CurrentControlSet" > "Enum" > "USB".</li>
			<li>In this list, select the entry for the EasyHome device (given by VID und PID you noted)</li>
			<li>Open the Subfolder "Device Paramteters" and double click the property "EnhancedPowerManagementEnabled" which appears in the right window section</li>
			<li>Change the property value from 1 to 0 and commit by clicking "OK"</li>
			<li>Restart you PC - now hopefully the EasyHome works as intended.</li>
		</ul>
		<H2>Udev rules Linux</H2>
		You must run the ARE as root for being able to access the device. Alternatively you can define a <a href="https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/blob/master/udev/99-hid.rules">udev rule</a>
		<H2>Event Listener Description</H2>
		See table below for a list of all commands that can be triggered
		<table>
			<caption>Command Mapping</caption>

		To dim the light you have to sent an on signal when the light is already turned on.
