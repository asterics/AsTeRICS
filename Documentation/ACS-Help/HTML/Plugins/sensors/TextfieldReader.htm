<H1>Textfield Reader</H1>
<H3>Component Type: Sensor (Subcategory: Graphical User Interface)</H3>
<p>Similar to the Keyboard Hook component, this component provides access to keystrokes coming from a standard keyboard or injected via software. The difference to the Keyboard Hook is that the Text Field Reader opens a GUI element with a text input filed and processes key input only from this text field. The keycodes of the pressed keys and accumulated words (multiple keys separated by <space>) are provided at the output ports of this component. Possible applications include triggering functions by keyboard input or remapping keys to other keycodes.</p>

A keyboard which generates keystrokes or a software component which injects keystrokes into the operating system?s message queue. 
<H2>Output Port Description</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>keys [integer]:</STRONG> This port sends the virtual keycode of the last pressed key as an integer value.</li>
<li><STRONG>words [string]:</STRONG> This ports accumulates keystrokes and sends them as a string as soon as a blank separator (space key) appears in the key input stream.</li>
</ul>
<H2>Event Trigger Description</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>recognizedCommand1 - recognizedCommand7:</STRONG> These event ports fire an event if one of seven command strings has been detected in the current input stream of keys.</li>
</ul>
<H2>Properties</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>command1 [string] - command7 [string]:</STRONG> Seven string properties to specify command strings. The component looks for these command strings in the input stream of keystrokes.
