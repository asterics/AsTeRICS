# About Us

The AsTeRICS framework was initially developed from 2010 to 2013 by an international consortium, led by [KI-I](https://www.ki-i.at). The technical management was done by [UAS Technikum Wien](https://embsys.technikum-wien.at/projects/asterics/index.php). The project was funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7 - 2007-2013). G.A.No. 247730.
