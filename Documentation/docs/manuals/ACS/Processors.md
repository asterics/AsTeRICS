# Processors

Processors are components which modify data provided by other plugins. Thus processors contain input ports as well as output ports and are placed in the middle of the ARE processing chain. Types of processors are either data modifiers (such as amplifiers and averagers) or flow control elements (such as conditional path selectors).
