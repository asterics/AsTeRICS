# Component Collection Manager

The Component Collection Manager (see Figure below) is a small tool in which downloaded component collections (the description of the available plugins within the AsTeRICS Runtime Environment) can be saved and administered. Within the component collection manager, the following functionalities are provided:

*   _Use Default_ sets the default ACS component collection as active component collection
*   _Set as Autostart_ sets the active component collection as autostart component collection, which will be loaded at ACS startup.
*   _Save Component Collection_ saves the active component collection (e.g. a downloaded component collection from the ARE) into the ACS folder.
*   The _Saved Component Collections_ list shows all saved component collections. A component collection can be selected and set active.
