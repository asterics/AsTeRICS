# Running

After the _Start Model_ button has been pressed, the ACS is in the _running_ mode. Within this mode, the drawing area is disabled (indicated by a grey background) and the buttons in the components tab and the edit tab are disabled, so elements can only be selected or moved. The following figure shows a screenshot of the ACS in running mode.
