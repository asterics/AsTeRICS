# Status Reporting and Error Logging

Within the tab _Miscellaneous_ (Misc.), status information and error logging can be requested from the ARE (if an active connection to the ARE is available).

*   _Get ARE Status_ opens a window, showing status messages from the ARE and from the components within the ARE. These messages can be copied to the clipboard or saved to a file:

Beside this general information, the status of each component can be requested using the _Show Component Status_ in the context menu of each component. The following figure shows a component with a red background - this means an error occurred in this component. The status window shows this error and with the button _Remove Error Marker_ the red background can be removed.
