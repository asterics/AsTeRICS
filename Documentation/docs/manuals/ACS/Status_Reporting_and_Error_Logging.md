# Status Reporting and Error Logging

Within the tab _Miscellaneous_ (Misc.), status information and error logging can be requested from the ARE (if an active connection to the ARE is available).

Beside this general information, the status of each component can be requested using the _Show Component Status_ in the context menu of each component. The following figure shows a component with a red background - this means an error occurred in this component. The status window shows this error and with the button _Remove Error Marker_ the red background can be removed.
