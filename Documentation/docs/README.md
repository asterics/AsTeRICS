## Why AsTeRICS?

There are many Assistive Technologies available on the market, but in many cases they are too expensive or not suitable for a certain combination of disabilities.

**AsTeRICS**

- provides support for many consumer devices which can be used as input devices (e.g. switches, eye-tracker, webcam, ...).
- let's you combine several input devices depending on your capabilities (e.g. 2 switches + 1 eye-tracker).
- provides support for many use cases (e.g. computer control, environmental control).
- has more than 160 plugins.
- allows easily customizing existing solutions or designing new ones.
- is Open Source, which means that it is free forever and others can contribute to the framework.

## Partners & Funding

The AsTeRICS project was funded by international and national research grants. AsTeRICS was initiated by [KI-I Linz](https://www.ki-i.at) and the [UAS Technikum Wien](https://www.technikum-wien.at/). The creation of this web page was funded by the City of Vienna, MA23, in course of the project **StudyATHome Internationally** (Grant Nr. 22-07). In Feb. 2017 the [AsTeRICS Foundation](https://www.asterics-foundation.org) was founded to bring the project results to people with disabilities, to organize workshops and to maintain project results, see [About Us](/get-involved/About-us.md).
