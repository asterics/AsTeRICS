## Why AsTeRICS?

There are many Assistive Technologies available on the market, but in many cases they are too expensive or not suitable for a certain combination of disabilities.

**AsTeRICS**

- provides support for many consumer devices which can be used as input devices (e.g. switches, eye-tracker, webcam, ...).
- let's you combine several input devices depending on your capabilities (e.g. 2 switches + 1 eye-tracker).
- provides support for many use cases (e.g. computer control, environmental control).
- has more than 160 plugins.
- allows easily customizing existing solutions or designing new ones.
- is Open Source, which means that it is free forever and others can contribute to the framework.

## Partners & Funding

The creation of this web page was funded by the City of Vienna, MA23, in course of the project **StudyATHome Internationally** (Grant Nr. 22-07).
