# Model Customization

In this tutorial you will learn how to do simple modifications to a model like changing a plugin property. This can be useful if you want to change the camera device to be used or want to change the key triggering a user action.

## Open model

First you have to open the model. There are two ways to do this:

### Model of Solutions

If you want to customize a model of the [solutions](/solutions/) page, click the ```Edit``` button of it. This opens the WebACS with the given model in a new browser tab.

### Deployed Model

If the ARE is running, you can press ```F8``` or click the ![Edit button](../img/are-model-edit.png) button in the control panel. This opens the WebACS with the given model in a new browser tab.

## Change Plugin Property

As soon as the model is opened, you can click onto a plugin to change it's property values. A property is a configuration item to modify the behaviour of that plugin.
