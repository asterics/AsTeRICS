# Tutorials

::: tip Note
If you are an **occupational therapist** or an **assistive technology professional** or simply want to **customize** or **create** new solutions, this is the right place for you.

In this section you will find tutorials about model creation and editing.
:::

If you would like to use a solution for a dedicated person with disabilities, go to the [solutions](/solutions/) page and start experimenting with solutions of the needed use case. Some solutions directly provide a settings page by clicking the `Settings` button. In case of the camera mouse this allows to configure the camera device, the mouse speed and other settings. Otherwise you will have to edit the underlying model directly. This can be done by clicking the `Edit` button.

## Go to

- [**Model Customization**](./customize/model/Model-Customization) to learn how to modify a given model and adapt single properties.
- [**Model Creation**](./customize/model/Model-Creation) to learn how to create a new model.
