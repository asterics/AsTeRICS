# Sensors

Sensors are defined as components which generate data to be processed within the processing chain set up in the AsTeRICS Runtime Environment. Sensors can either generate data in the component itself (e.g. a signal generator) or they can read data from an external sensor (such as an ADC or a digital GPIO port). Sensors only contain output ports as no input data from within the ARE is needed.
