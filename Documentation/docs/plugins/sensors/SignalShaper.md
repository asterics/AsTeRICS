Example composed signal created from three linear signals

## Output Port Description

- **output \[double\]:** The output port for the signal.

## Event Listener Description

- **start:** Start the signal generation. If this event is received during signal generation, the signal generation is restarted.

## Properties

- **interval \[integer\]:** The samplingÂ  rate in milliseconds.

- **numberOfLines \[integer\]:** The number of linear signals used to shape the output signal.

- **behaviourAfterFinish \[\*\***integer\***\*\]:** Defines the component behaviour after all signal lines have been sent:
  - **do nothing:** stop any action.

  - **repeat:** Send the signal lines from beginning.

  - **send the last value:** Continue to send the last value of the signal.
- **beginValue1...beginValue5 \[double\]:** The begin value of the linear signals.
- **endValue1...endValue5 \[double\]:** The end value of the linear signals.
- **time1...time5 \[integer\]:** The duration of the linear signals in milliseconds.
