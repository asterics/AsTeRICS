# XFacetrackerLK

### Component Type: Sensor (Subcategory: Computer Vision)

OS: Windows (x86, x64), Linux (x86, x64, RPi3), Mac OSX

This component provides a cross-platform face tracking computer vision algorithm which puts out estimated movement of a user's nose and chin in x and y coordinates. The underlying mechanism builds upon the [JavaCV library][1] for frame grabbing and computer vision processing. In particular a trained cascade of haar-like features is used in combination with a Lukas Kanade optical flow algorithm to track a face and its movement. The x- and y- coordinates can be used in camera-mouse configurations or to enable selection or control tasks. The values are only provided if a face can be tracked by the algorithm. Note that the x- and y- values represent relative movement in pixels and have to be accumulated (e.g. via the integrate component) to generate e.g. absolute mouse positions.

## Requirements

A camera has to be available (this can be any webcam or a camera which is available as image acquisition device via the operating system). The picture below shows the Logitech Webcam 9000 Pro. Also the camera device of a Kinect sensor or PS3Eye should work. Furthermore, a video stream of an IP camera can be used for tracking.

### Note for Raspberry Pi

The plugin can be used on a Raspberry Pi 3 (tested with Raspbian Jessie) with USB cameras, the Kinect camera or the [Raspberry Pi camera module][2].

In order for the raspi cam to work, the following steps are necessary:

1.  Enable the camera with

    ```bash
    sudo raspi-config
    ```

2.  Add the v4l driver for the camera, to make it accessible as /dev/videoXX device:

    ```bash
    sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2 max_video_width=2592 max_video_height=1944
    ```

## Output Port Description

- **noseX \[integer\]:** This value specifies the relative change in the x coordinate of the user's nose with respect to the previous image frame.
- **noseY \[integer\]:** This value specifies the relative change in the y coordinate of the user's nose with respect to the previous image frame.
- **chinX \[integer\]:** This value specifies the relative change in the x coordinate of the user's chin with respect to the previous image frame.
- **chinY \[integer\]:** This value specifies the relative change in the y coordinate of the user's chin with respect to the previous image frame.

## Event Listener Description

- **init:** if this event is triggered, the face recognition procedure is initiated. This can be useful if the correct face position has been lost due to drifting of the LK algorithm.
- **showCameraSettings** an incoming event displays the settings window for the camera device (only on Windows), where parameters like image brightness or contrast can be adjusted.

## Properties

- **frameGrabber\[string, combobox selection\]:** Name of FrameGrabber to use (Default, VideoInput, OpenCV, FFmpeg, OpenKinect, PS3Eye, IPCamera).
- **frameGrabberFormat\[string\]:** Format for grabber, e.g. FFmpeg: 'dshow' (default), 'vfwcap', 'gdigrab'.
- **deviceList \[string, combobox selection\]:** List of available devices, if supported by grabber
- **cameraSelection \[string\]:** The camera device to be used - use camdIdx e.g. '0' (VideoInput, OpenCV, OpenKinect, PS3Eye), or camName e.g. 'video=Integrated Camera' or 'desktop' (FFmpeg), stream-url for IPCamera.
- **cameraResolution \[string, combobox selection\]:** This selection box provides several standard camera resolutions. Changing the resolution affects accuracy and performance (CPU load of the runtime system). Provided selections include 160x120, 320x240, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768 and 1600x1200.
- **frameRate \[integer\]:** The frame rate to use for frame grabbing. In case of 0 or a negative value, the maximum frame rate will be used.
- **titleVideoFrameWindow \[string\]:** The title of the window showing the video frame.
- **displayGUI \[boolean\]:** if selected, the GUI window will be shown.
- **enableOverlaySettings \[boolean\]:** if selected, the video frame shows the current frame rate and device name as overlayed text.

### MJPEG stream of SmartPhone camera

Install the following Android app on your smartphone and start streaming the front camera: [Camera Stream - WiFi IP Webcam (Web Host LLC)][3]

Enter the http url displayed at your smartphone and add /video to the url

e.g.

http://192.168.1.100:8080/video

Set the cameraSelection property of the XFacetrackerLK plugin to this url.

Configuration

- frameGrabber:IPCamera
- cameraSelection:http://192.168.1.100:8080/video
