# IntelRealSense

Component Type: Sensor (Subcategory: Computer Vision)

OS: >= Windows 8.1, 64 bit

This component interfaces the Intel Real Sense F200 (SR300) 3D camera and provides head tracking and facial gesture recognition functionality. The head tracking could be used for camera mouse applications and provides 3D absolute coordinates. The facial gestures could be used for simple actions like mouse click or key emulation. Each facial gesture has a recognition score. The user can define the threshold that triggers an event when the score exceeds the threshold.

## Requirements

You need an [Intel Real Sense F200 (SR300)][1] camera plugged in and the SDK installed and running. The camera only supports Windows (>= 8.1, 64 Bit).
