Philips Hue sensor plugin

## Requirements

- A Philips Hue hardware Bridge
- A Philips Hue Sensor (a dimmer switch or a motion sensor)

## Initial Setup

See the PhilipsHue actuator plugin documentation for detailed instructions.

## Output Port Description

- **currentState \[string\]:** This port periodically returns the state the target sensor. The polling rate can be set via the updateRate property (in milliseconds).

## Event Trigger Description

- **statusChanged:** fires when the configure sensor changes its status (buttons pressed, motion detected, battery charge, etc.)
- **tick:** fires for each tick (depends on updateRate property)
- **motionDetected:** fires once presence is detected (motion sensor only)
- **dimmerButtonOn:** fires if the first button is pressed (dimmer switch only)
- **dimmerButtonBrighter:** fires if the second button is pressed (dimmer switch only)
- **dimmerButtonDarker:** fires if the third button is pressed (dimmer switch only)
- **dimmerButtonOff:** fires if the last button is pressed (dimmer switch only)

## Properties

- **apiKey \[string\]:** API key for the REST API of the bridge
- **ip \[string\]:** IP address of the bridge
- **target \[string\]:** sensor that should be used as input in the form `/sensors/<id>`
- **updateRate \[integer\]:** polling rate for **currentState** and the event triggers
  - value in milliseconds
  - the lower this value is, the faster you will be notified of changes
  - don't set this too low or the bridge might slow down (500 milliseconds is a good compromise)
