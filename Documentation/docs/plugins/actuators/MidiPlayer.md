Component Type: Actuator (Subcategory: Audio and Voice)

The MidiPlayer component can generate midi tone output on the default midi device of the system. This can be used for audio feedback (e.g. for a selection or click) or for creation of musical instruments. The MidiPlayer Plugin features an optional GUI where the currently played tone can be seen.
