## Input Port Description

- **command \[string\]:** The plugin reacts to incoming action strings starting with "@GPIO:" and a command. Valid commands are "set", "clear", "toggle" and "press". The command has to be followed by a comma and the port number, for example: "@GPIO:set,1" or "@GPIO:toggle,2". The following examples illustrate the available action strings:
  - \_"@DIGITALOUT:set,1":\_Output port 1 of the Personal Platform will be set (5 Volt)
  - \_"@DIGITALOUT:clear,2":\_Output port 2 of the Personal Platform will be cleared (0 Volt)
  - \_"@DIGITALOUT:toggle,1":\_Output port 1 of the Personal Platform will be changed

## Event Listener Description

- **setOutput1 to setOutput2:** an incoming event on these ports will cause the corresponding output port to go to the high level.
- **clearOutput1 to clearOutput2:** an incoming event on these ports will cause the corresponding output port to go to the low level.
