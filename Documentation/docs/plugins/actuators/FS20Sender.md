## Notes on Linux platform

If you installed AsTeRICS as package, all necessary permission already set. If you built AsTeRICS on your own, please type following command on a terminal window:

_sudo echo 'ATTRS{idProduct}=="e015", ATTRS{idVendor}=="18ef", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/50-asterics-fs20.rules_

Onw additional command is necessary if you work on ARM based platforms (RaspberryPi, BananaPi,...):

_sudo ln -sf /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libudev.so.1 /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libudev.so.0_

Afterwards, unplug and plug in the FS20 device and restart AsTeRICS.
