# Decimation

Component Type: Processor (Subcategory: Basic Math)

The decimation operation performed by this component consists in an anti-aliasing low band pass filter plus a down-sampling. The component outputs a computed sample after receiving a certain number of input samples according to the down-sampling-ratio property value. So the resultant signal is like the original signal, but sampled to a lower ratio determined by the mentioned property.
