# openHAB

Component Type: Processors (Subcategory: Home Control)

The openHAB component interfaces to an openHAB instance, which is used to configure and use a home control environment. Usually, openHAB is stand-alone. Therefore it has its own GUI, many many possible interfacing solutions (called bindings) and a configuration tool (based on Eclipse). More information is available here: [openHAB][1].

This component uses the provided [REST API of openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/restdocs.html) to read and write the state of different nodes (called items) within the openHAB system.

## Requirements

The plugin expects

* a functional [openHAB installation](https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/)
  
### Start OpenHAB

To run openHAB without password authentication, start openHAB with this command:

#### Linux

On a debian-based system this should be:

```bash
sudo openhab-cli start
```

#### Windows

in the openHAB folder, double click on ```start_debug.sh```

<!-- ### User Authentication

**not yet implemented**   -->
<!-- In addition, it is also possible to provide HTTP basic authentication with username/password. 
Please note, that any saved password in the AsTeRICS model is stored in the model file in PLAINTEXT!

To start with password authentication, use following command:  
_bash ./start\_debug.sh -Djava.security.auth.login.config=./etc/login.conf_  
The user configuration is handled via this file:  
_openHAB\_runtime/configurations/users.cfg_ Please note, that the first line is necessary, so do not remove it!  
Further information on configuration and usage of openHAB is available on the openHAB GitHub page ([openHAB][1]). -->

## Example

1. [Install openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/)
2. Start openHab
3. [Create demo package](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/packages.html#demo-package-sample-setup) at first time startup
4. Open the model [ARE/models/componentTests/processors/openHAB_simple_test.acs](http://webacs.asterics.eu/?areBaseURI=https://127.0.0.1:8083&openFile=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asterics/AsTeRICS/master/bin/ARE/models/componentTests/processors/openHAB_simple_test.acs)
5. Upload/Start model
6. Open [Basic UI of the Kitchen](http://localhost:8080/basicui/app?w=GF_Kitchen&sitemap=demo)
7. In ARE GUI: Click on ```Item Light_GF_Kitchen_Ceiling ON``` or ```Item Light_GF_Kitchen_Ceiling OFF```. You should see the switching of the item in the basic UI accordingly.
8. Change a value in the basic UI, you should get an event in the event visualizer of the ARE GUI.

## Input Port Description

*   **item1in \[string\]:** New state for item1 (the corresponding name is set in the property item1in). For example: set the property item1in to Light\_GF\_Bed\_Ceiling and send "ON" to the input port to switch on the light which is connected to this item.
*   **item2in \[string\]:** New state for item2 (the corresponding name is set in the property item2in). Example: see input port item1in
*   **item3in \[string\]:** New state for item3 (the corresponding name is set in the property item3in). Example: see input port item1in
*   **item4in \[string\]:** New state for item4 (the corresponding name is set in the property item4in). Example: see input port item1in
*   **item5in \[string\]:** New state for item5 (the corresponding name is set in the property item5in). Example: see input port item1in
*   **item6in \[string\]:** New state for item6 (the corresponding name is set in the property item6in). Example: see input port item1in
*   **actionString \[string\]:** Action String syntax is as follows: ```@OPENHAB:<itemName>,<itemValue>``` or ```<itemName>,<itemValue>```. 
Example: ```@OPENHAB:Light_GF_Kitchen_Ceiling,ON``` or ```Light_GF_Kitchen_Ceiling,ON```. For allowed item values, check the [Item Type Description](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/items.html#type).

## Output Port Description

*   **item1 \[string\] - item6 \[string\]:** The current state of the items1 to items6, corresponding to the item names of properties item1out to item6out

## Event Trigger Description

*   **item1change - item6change:** This event is triggered if the corresponding item (set by the properties item1event to item6event) changes its state. The initial value is NOT raising an event.

## Properties

*   **updaterate \[integer\]:** Time in milliseconds, which will ellapse between each status update. Default: 1s (1000ms)
*   **hostname \[string\]:** Hostname to connect to. It is possible to use a hostname, an IP adress or a FQDN
*   **port \[string\]:** Port of the openHAB installation. Defaults: 8080 for HTTP, 8443 for HTTPS. Please take care of any blocking firewall.
*   **protocol \[string\]:** Protocol to connect to openHAB. Either http or https may be used (recommended: https).
*   **lazyCertificates \[boolean\]:** If this property is set, any SSL related certificate check will be removed for the given hostname. This affects the hole ARE.
*   **username \[string\]:** This property is used, if the HTTP basic authentication of openHAB is used. Provide the username here.
*   **password \[string\]:** This property is used, if the HTTP basic authentication of openHAB is used. Provide the password here.
*   **item1in \[string\]:** Item name, which is used for the input port 1 (set an openHAB item)
*   **item2in \[string\]:** Item name, which is used for the input port 2 (set an openHAB item)
*   **item3in \[string\]:** Item name, which is used for the input port 3 (set an openHAB item)
*   **item4in \[string\]:** Item name, which is used for the input port 4 (set an openHAB item)
*   **item5in \[string\]:** Item name, which is used for the input port 5 (set an openHAB item)
*   **item6in \[string\]:** Item name, which is used for the input port 6 (set an openHAB item)
*   **item1out \[string\]:** Item name, which is used for the output port 1 (fetch an openHAB item with the given updaterate)
*   **item2out \[string\]:** Item name, which is used for the output port 2 (fetch an openHAB item with the given updaterate)
*   **item3out \[string\]:** Item name, which is used for the output port 3 (fetch an openHAB item with the given updaterate)
*   **item4out \[string\]:** Item name, which is used for the output port 4 (fetch an openHAB item with the given updaterate)
*   **item5out \[string\]:** Item name, which is used for the output port 5 (fetch an openHAB item with the given updaterate)
*   **item6out \[string\]:** Item name, which is used for the output port 6 (fetch an openHAB item with the given updaterate)
*   **item1event \[string\]:** Item name, which is used to raise an event if the state is changed (item1change)
*   **item2event \[string\]:** Item name, which is used to raise an event if the state is changed (item2change)
*   **item3event \[string\]:** Item name, which is used to raise an event if the state is changed (item3change)
*   **item4event \[string\]:** Item name, which is used to raise an event if the state is changed (item4change)

*   **item6event \[string\]:** Item name, which is used to raise an event if the state is changed (item6change)

## Additional hints

* [Interactive openHAB REST documentation](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/restdocs.html#rest-api-documentation): Install the add-on ```REST Documentation```. On the welcome screen of openHAB, you will now see a new interface called "REST API" where you can easily see the documentation of the REST API and test it!
* To find and copy an item name you can click on the copy icon ![Screenshot of Paper UI item configurations](./img/openhab_copy-item-name.png) of an item in the [Paper UI](http://localhost:8080/paperui/index.html#/configuration/items).
*   The model will stop with an error message, if one of the item names in the properties is not found.
*   There is no feedback for checking a successful state change. E.g.: if your write to a read-only item (temperature sensor), nothing will happen
*   Use the _lazyCertificates_ property with care, it will disable a major part of the SSL handshaking for the whole Java session. It should be limited to the given hostname only, but without warranty.
*   The username/password combination from the properties is saved in PLAINTEXT in the model file, so handle it with care.
