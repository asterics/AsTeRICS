# AsTeRICS Documentation

This is the old location of the AsTeRICS user and developer manuals. The documentation is now edited in markdown in the [docs](./docs/) subfolder. 

The old documents still contain some details about plugin programming and ARE internals, but the important information should already be online at https://www.asterics.eu/.

The new documentation is structured as follows

* [getting started](./docs/get-started/)
* [tutorials for models / customization](./docs/customize/)
* [manuals](./docs/manuals/)
* [plugin documentation](./docs/plugins/)
* [code / plugin development](./docs/develop/)

The content will be periodically updated and be available at [www.asterics.eu](https://www.asterics.eu)
