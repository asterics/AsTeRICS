There are different file versions, depending on the Lipmouse design (especially the mouth piece and mounting construction):

###lipmouse_case_lasercut.cdr

This is the original design, produced by Robert Haderer.
It uses a zigarette mouthpiece, which is plugged into plate2


###lipmouse_case_lasercut_v2_sidemount.cdr

An improved design of lipmouse_case_lasercut.cdr, where the front plate
carries the construction (plate 1 is removed). In addition, the front plate hole is extended.
For mounting the Lipmouse, a 10mm hole is added in one side plate.


###lipmouse_case_lasercut_v2_backmount.cdr

The same design as lipmouse_case_lasercut_v2_sidemount.cdr, but instead of the side-mount hole, a 10mm hole in the back plane is used.



###lipmouse_case_lasercut_v2.cdr

The same design as lipmouse_case_lasercut_v2_backmount.cdr, but without any mounting holes (may be used for glueing to a plate...)



###lipmouse_case_lasercut_quadjoy_sidemount.cdr

The same design as lipmouse_case_lasercut_v2_sidemount.cdr, but instead of the zigarette-holder mouth-piece, a filter construction of quadjoy is used as mouthpiece



###lipmouse_case_lasercut_quadjoy_backmount.cdr

The same design as lipmouse_case_lasercut_v2_backmount.cdr, but instead of the zigarette-holder mouth-piece, a filter construction of quadjoy is used as mouthpiece


###lipmouse_case_lasercut_v2.1_backmount.cdr

Small improvements


###lipmouse_case_lasercut_v2.2_backmount.cdr

Improved case design: Main mechanics part (2 plates + sensors + PCB) can be put together without glueing. Adjustment of pressure sensor bias force without moving the main parts. RECOMMENDED!




###lipmouse_case_lasercut_v2.3_backmount.cdr

Improved case design: No glued screw nut neccessary for the housing. In addition, a screw thread is cut to the mechanical carrier plates, so no screw nuts are neccessary for the whole design


###lipmouse_case_lasercut_v2.4_backmount.cdr

Improved case design: top plate mounting parts are moved inside the housing, making a smaller outline;
closed a small gap at the backplane (improves stability and design)
contains a part for testing and productive laser cutting.
Future versions will have 2 housings on a 250mmx250mm acrylic glass.
Added the settings file lipsy_v2.3.sgx for the laser cutter software (Spirit GX). These settings are valid for all future versions of the CDR files, except there is a SGX file with a higher version number
