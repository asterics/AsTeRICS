The teensy.exe loader application allows updating the firmware (.hex files) 
of the Teensy-based modules (e.g. the Lipmouse, FABI, Teensy_RC or Sensorboard).

This application has been developed by PJRC, please refer to:
https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html

If you want to update firmware of a bare AVR-based module (like the HID-actuator or ProximityCIM)
you can use the Atmel Flip tool (see subfolder HID-actuator/tools).
