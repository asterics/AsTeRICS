AsTeRICS proximity CIM, FHTW

The firmware fits for the Atmel AVR AT90USB1286 microcontroller 
(e.g. mounted on the "teensy++" board, see http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html)

The proximity CIM provides a distance measurement curcuit based upun a CNY-70 infrared object detection sensor.
It can be used a assistive input device for persons to select / control via small movement e.g. of a finger or of the chin.

Important files/folders:
