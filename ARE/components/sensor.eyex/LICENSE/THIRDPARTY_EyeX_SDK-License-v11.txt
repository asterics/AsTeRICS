Section 1, the following defined terms are used in this Agreement: 

2.1 “Application” means any software application developed by 
Licensee (i) using the SDK; and/or (ii) including the Software 
Components (and any Updates, modifications and/or patches or hot 
fixes thereto that Tobii may make generally available from time to 
time). 
2.2 “Confidential Information” shall mean all information 
provided by Tobii under this Agreement (except information which 
becomes publicly available without an act of default by Licensee) 
which Tobii has declared confidential or which Licensee should have 
understood to be confidential. 
2.3 “Effective Date” means the date when the Licensee 
downloads the SDK. 
2.4 “End User” means any person or entity that sub-licenses 
Software Components through Licensee (or Licensee’s appointed

library files, commonly referred to as DLL-files or .SO files), object 
code or other components of the SDK (and any Updates, 
modifications and/or patches or hot fixes thereto that Tobii may make 
generally available from time to time) that are intended to be reused 
in an Application. 
2.8 “Tobii Hardware and Software” means eye tracking 
hardware and software components designed or provided by Tobii 
AB. These components may be provided directly by Tobii or 
incorporated within a third party product. 
2.9 ”Tobii Materials” means the SDK (including the Software

enhance a prior release of the SDK or a Software Component. 
3. 
Grant of License. 
3.1 License. Subject to the limitations specified in this Agreement, 
Licensee is granted a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, nonassignable, 
revocable and nonexclusive license to use the SDK 
(including the Software Components and Sample Code) solely to 
develop and distribute Applications for Gaze Interaction that process 
data from Tobii Hardware and Software for the purpose of Gaze 
Interaction. 
3.2 Development. The Licensee may, solely for the purpose of 
developing Applications as specified in Section 3.1 above: 
3.2.1 Install and use Software Components on computers owned 
and controlled by Licensee; and 
3.2.2 Distribute a reasonable amount of copies of the documentation 
of the SDK among Licensee’s employees and consultants; and 
3.2.3 Incorporate the Software Components into the developed 
Applications; and 
3.2.4 Modify and copy the source code form or object form of Sample

copy and distribute any portion of the Software Components and 
Sample Code as part of the Application necessary for the Application 
to function for Gaze Interaction, intended to be sold, licensed or 
otherwise disposed of by Licensee. 
3.4 
Limitations. 
3.4.1 Not for analytical use. Unless Licensee enters into a separate 
agreement with Tobii, the SDK may not be used to develop and 
distribute software for analytical purposes, post processing or 
aggregation of eye tracking data across multiple users. 
Specifically, this means that such software may not (i) transfer 
data about eye movements, behavior, intention or attention 
generated by or derived from the Software Components to 
another computing device, network, display or printer; or (ii) 
store data about eye movements, behavior, intention or 
attention generated by or derived from the Software 
Components on any persistent storage media (except for 
calibration files and data used for accuracy-enhancing filters), 
i.e. data may only be stored in primary memory and only while 
it is being processed. 
3.4.2 Copy, etc. Licensee may not (i) copy (except as provided for in 
this Agreement or for backup purposes), modify, adapt, 
decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative 
works of the SDK or any part thereof (including the Software 
Components); or (ii) use the SDK to build Applications that may 
be used as an SDK providing API’s that use functionality from 
the Software Components. 
3.4.3 No other distribution. 
Except for the Software Components 
incorporated in an Application, Licensee may not under this 
Agreement distribute, sub-license or combine/bundle any part 
of the SDK (including the Software Components) with other 
software, or distribute any software or device incorporating any 
part of the SDK. 
3.4.4 Updates. 
The terms of this Agreement will apply to any 
Updates, modifications and/or patches or hot fixes that Tobii 
makes available to Licensee. Licensee agrees that Updates 
may require Licensee to change or update the Applications. 
Updates may also affect Licensee’s ability to use, access or 
interact with the SDK. 
3.4.5 No high risk use. 
The Software Components are not fault-
tolerant. Accordingly, the Software Components are not 
designed or intended for use in any software where failure or 
fault of any kind could lead to death or serious bodily injury of 
any person, or to severe physical or environmental damage 
(“High Risk Use”). The SDK may only be used to develop 
Applications that do not (and the Software Components may 
only be distributed and sub-licensed as permitted herein if the 
Application does not) involve High Risk Use. High Risk Use 
(which is strictly prohibited) includes, for example, aircraft 
navigation and control of other modes of human mass 
transportation, control of nuclear or chemical facilities. 
4. Support. Tobii is not obliged to support Licensee regarding the 
use of the SDK (including the Software Components) unless a 
separate support agreement between the parties has been entered 
into. 
5. Trademarks. Licensee shall not remove or alter any 
Trademark, copyright, patent or other proprietary notices contained 
in the SDK (including the Software Components). 
6. Ownership. Except for the license explicitly granted herein to 
Licensee, Tobii retains all right, title and interest in and to the Tobii 
Materials, and all patents, copyrights, Trademarks, trade names, 
trade secrets and other proprietary rights in or related to the Tobii 
Materials, whether or not specifically recognized or perfected under 
the laws of the country in which the Tobii Materials are located. 
7. Changes. Tobii reserve the right to change in its sole discretion 
this Agreement or the SDK at any time. Tobii may require that 
Licensee either accepts and agrees to new or revised terms of this 
Agreement, or, if Licensee does not agree to the new or revised 
terms, ceases or terminates the use of the SDK. Licensee’s 
continued use of the SDK after changes to this Agreement take effect 
will constitute Licensee’s acceptances of the changed terms. If 
Licensee does not agree to a change, Licensee must stop using the 
SDK and terminate this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, 
changed terms do not take retroactive effect with respect to any 
Application developed before the change or any Application first 
distributed before the change. 
8. 
Term and Termination. 
8.1 Term. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective 
Date and shall continue until terminated. 
8.2 Termination by Licensee. Licensee may terminate this 
Agreement at any time by (i) uninstalling and destroying all copies of 
the SDK that are in the possession, custody or control of Licensee 
and its organization; and (ii) providing Tobii written notice thereof.

8.3 Termination by Tobii. Tobii may, at any time, terminate this 
Agreement with Licensee for any reason or for no reason in Tobii’s 
sole discretion and, in such a case, Licensee must immediately (i) 
cease using the SDK; and (ii) provide Tobii written notice thereof. 
8.4 Survival of obligations. The following obligations will survive 
termination of the Agreement for any reason: (i) all obligations 
relating to protection of proprietary rights; and (ii) all provisions 
regarding the limitations of warranty, remedy and liability. 
8.5 Effects of termination. Upon termination of this Agreement 
for any reason, all rights and licenses granted hereunder shall 
terminate and revert to Tobii. Any termination of this Agreement 
except for termination due to Licensee’s breach of contract will not 
affect Licensee’s right, subject to Licensee´s continued compliance 
with Licensee’s obligations under this Agreement, to continue to 
distribute versions of the Applications created and first distributed 
before termination, and will not affect the right of the End Users to 
continue using such versions of the Application, both of which rights 
will survive termination. 
9. 
Indemnification. 
Licensee shall defend and hold Tobii and its subsidiaries harmless 
from losses finally arising from any third party claim that an 
Application infringes any patent, trade secret or copyright of any third 
party or resulting from Licensee’s breach of this Agreement; provided 
that, Licensee shall not have any obligation to indemnify Tobii or its 
subsidiary if such claim is caused by one or several Software 
Components as provided by Tobii, provided that: (a) Licensee is 
promptly notified in writing of the claim; (b) Licensee has, subject to 
the below, sole control in the defense of any claim and any settlement 
negotiations attendant thereto; and (c) Tobii provides Licensee, at 
Licensee’s expense, all reasonable assistance, information and 
cooperation to defend or settle the claim. Licensee shall not enter into 
any settlement of any claim covered by the above indemnification 
without the prior approval of Tobii, which approval will not be 
unreasonably withheld. Tobii shall have the right to retain separate 
counsel and participate in the defense of the action or claim at its own 
expense.
