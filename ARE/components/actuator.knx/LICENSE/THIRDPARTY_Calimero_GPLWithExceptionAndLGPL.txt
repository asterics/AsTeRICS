Calimero 2.1 KNX library: http://sourceforge.net/projects/calimero/
licenses: GPL with Classpath exception, LGPL

Modules licensed under the “GPL with Classpath exception” are distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (see http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) with the following clarification and special exception:
Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
As such, it can be used to run, create and distribute a large class of applications and applets. When GNU Classpath is used unmodified as the core class library for a virtual machine, compiler for the java languge, or for a program written in the java programming language it does not affect the licensing for distributing those programs directly.
Classpath Documentation Redistribution Policy
GNU Documentation is unique because of our attitude towards it. We believe the reader should be free to copy and redistribute it, just like our software. Originally, all our documentation was released under a short Copyleft license, or under the GNU General Public License (GPL) itself; in 2001 the Free Documentation License (FDL) was created to address certain needs that were not met by licenses originally designed for software
