2. LICENSE GRANT: 

 

A. Subject to your timely payment of the license fees, if any, and compliance with all of the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, Intel grants to you a non-exclusive, non-assignable license under its 
copyrights in the Materials to: 




 

(i) internally reproduce and install a reasonable number of copies of the Materials for your internal use 
solely for the Purpose and in accordance with the documentation included in the Materials. 

 

(ii) create derivative works of the Redistributables, or any portions thereof, that are defined as Source 
Code solely for the Purpose. 

 

(iii) distribute (or otherwise make available) on a royalty-free basis, subject to any other terms and 
conditions which may appear in the Redistributables text files, the Redistributables, including any 
derivative works pursuant to Section 2(A)(ii), or any portions thereof, only as integrated or 
embedded in an Application (and not on a stand-alone basis). You may grant your customers the 
right to further distribute those Redistributables solely as integrated or embedded in Your 
Application. HOWEVER, IF YOU RECEIVED THE MATERIALS FOR THE PURPOSES OF 
EVALUATION, YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS TO DISTRIBUTE THE MATERIALS, INCLUDING 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE REDISTRIBUTABLES OR ANY PORTIONS THEREOF AND THE 
AFOREMENTIONED DERIVATIVE WORKS. 

 

B. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel grants to you a non-exclusive, 
non-assignable license under Intel’s Licensed Patent Claims, to: (i) make copies of the Materials 
internally only; (ii) use the Materials internally only; (ii) offer to distribute and distribute, but not sell, 





the Redistributables under the license under Intel’s copyrights granted in Section 3(A)(ii), but only 
under the terms of that copyright license and not as a sale; 




 

C. An essential basis of the bargain in this Agreement is that no licenses or other rights, including but 
not limited to patent, trade secret, and copyright licenses or rights, are granted to you by implication, 
estoppel or otherwise, except for the licenses expressly granted in Section 2A and 2B. The 
consideration provided under this Agreement is only for the licenses expressly granted to you in this 
Agreement. Any other rights, including but not limited to additional patent rights, would require an 
additional license and additional consideration. Nothing in this Agreement requires or will be treated 
to require Intel to grant any additional license. You acknowledge that there are significant uses of 
the Materials, or implementations of the Materials, in their original, unmodified, and uncombined 
form. Specifically, Intel expressly does not grant you a patent license in this Agreement to any 
modifications of or derivative works of the Materials, whether made by you, your contractor, your 
customer, or any other third party in creating the derivative works even to the extent creation of 
derivative works is permitted under 2(A)(ii). The consideration for the license in this Agreement 
reflects Intel’s continuing right to assert patent claims against any modifications or derivative works 
(including, without limitation, error corrections and bug fixes) of, or combinations with, the Materials 
or implementations of the Materials that infringe any Intel patent claim that is not a Licensed Patent 
Claim.
