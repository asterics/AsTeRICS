updates, 
. 
supplements, 
. 
documentation, and 
. 
support services 
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply. 


The software is licensed, not sold. By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the 
software, you accept all terms in this agreement. If you do not accept them, do not download, 

install, access, or use the software. “You” or “you” means the individual who downloads,

entity, and you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into this agreement 
for that entity). 

If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below. 

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. 
a. Installation and Use. You may (i) install and use any number of copies of the software (only when 
installed using the accompanying software installer package) on your computer to design, develop, and 
test your programs that run specifically on a Microsoft Windows operating system, and that are 
intended for use solely in connection with the Microsoft Kinect for Windows v2 sensor (“Kinect v2 
Sensor”), and its associated drivers and runtime software, and no other sensor unless such sensor is 
supported by Microsoft (collectively, the “Kinect v2 Applications”), and (ii) distribute your Kinect v2 
Applications, subject to the terms in this agreement. 
b. 
Telemetry Data Collection. When in use by you, the software will provide Microsoft with telemetry 
data (e.g., operating system, number of processors, graphic chipset, memory, device type, locale, 
time) regarding your installation and use. The data will not be used to identify specific individuals. 
Microsoft will use the Telemetry Data for product and service improvements. 
c. 
Included Microsoft Programs. The software includes other Microsoft programs. The license terms 
with those programs apply to your use of them. 
d. No High Risk Use. WARNING: The Kinect v2 Sensor and the software are not fault-tolerant. The 
Kinect v2 Sensor and the software are not designed or intended for use with any program where failure 
or fault of any kind of the Kinect v2 Sensor or software could lead to death or serious bodily injury of 
any person, or to severe physical or environmental damage (“High Risk Use”). You are not licensed to, 
and you agree not to, use, distribute or sublicense the use of the Kinect v2 Sensor and/or software in, 
or in conjunction with, High Risk Use. High Risk Use is STRICTLY PROHIBITED. High Risk Use 
includes, for example, the following: aircraft navigation and control of other modes of 
human mass transportation, nuclear or chemical facilities.

5. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND WAIVER. You acknowledge the software may allow you to control the 
Kinect v2 Sensor, which are mechanical hardware devices that include motors to move the device, a fan to

persons, or damage or destroy the Kinect v2 Sensor, products incorporating the Kinect v2 Sensor, or other 
property. In using the software, you must take steps to design and test your Kinect v2 Applications to ensure 
that your applications do not present unreasonable risks of personal injury or death, property damage, or 
other losses. Kinect v2 Sensors utilize complex hardware and software technology that may not always 
function as intended. You must design your application so that any failure of a Kinect v2 Sensor and/or the 
software does not cause personal injury or death, property damage, or other losses. If you choose to use the 
software, you assume all risk that your use of the Kinect v2 Sensors and/or the software causes any harm 
or loss, including to the end users of your Kinect v2 Applications, and you agree to waive all claims against 
Microsoft and its affiliates related to such use (including but not limited to any claim that a Kinect v2 Sensor 
or the software is defective) and to hold Microsoft and its affiliates harmless from such claims.
